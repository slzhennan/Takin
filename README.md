## What is Takin?
Takin is an Java-based, open-source system designed to measure online environmental performance test for full-links, Especially for microservices. Through ArchGuadian, middlewares and applications can identify real online traffic and test traffic, ensure that they enter the right databases.

# Why should we do online environmental performance test
Microservices Architecture is used commonly nowadays and it always make system complex to understand for humans. Moreover, businesses are also very complex in huge system. Business complexity and system complexity make it difficult to :
- Keep entire system highly available
- Maintain Research & Development efficiency.

In order to keep system high available, we usually make performance test on test environment or online single-service. However, test environment is very different from online environment, single-service can't stand for the whole service-links. They can't guarantee system performance.

**Microservices Are Complex**<br/>
Compare with monolithic application, Microservices architecture increases complexity for business system. It may maintain multiple tools and frameworks.

**Business Systems Are Complex**<br/>
Businesses involve different sections and many of them are long-process and complicated, such as E-Commerce businesses.

**The Microservices Relation Is Complex**<br/>
In a microservices architecture system with a lot of business services, the calling relation between services is very complicated. Every change may affect the availability of the entire system and make developers difficult to release new versions Frequently.

# Quick Start Instruction

**docker:**<br/>
- Docker mirror size ： 1.8 G

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 2181:2181 -p 3306:3306 -p 6379:6379 -p 8086:8086 -p 9000:9000 -p 10032:10032 -p 6628:6628 -p 8000:8000 -p 6627:6627 -p 8888:8888 -p 29900-29999:29900-29999 registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/forcecop/forcecop:v1.0.0
```

- Parameter：-d start in background，-p port. <br/>
The Initiation of docker need about 10 mins because it need install necessary components. -d can ignore installment information of components in background. If you dont't want to open your server's port, you can use --net=host and make sure it and host server are in the same network。
- Modify the IP address of the index.html file to the server's local IP address.
    ```
    # Enter Docker
    vi /data/apps/dist/tro/index.html
    # Modify serverUrl to the server's local IP address
    # Restart Nginx：
    nginx -s reload
    ```
